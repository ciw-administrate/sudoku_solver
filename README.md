# Sudoku Solver
As part of my PDP, it was recommended by Graham Savage that I should look at creating a Sudoku Solver.

I'll be using the following puzzles in order to test the application as it progresses.

## Project Scope
### Must Have
- Take a 9x9 incomplete sudoku puzzle as an input
- Output a correct and complete 9x9 solution
### Nice to Have
- Validation of inputs, should be able to handle:
    - Empty inputs
    - Inputs with numbers outside the expected range
- Handle unsolvable solutions
- Take puzzles of differing sizes
### Not in Scope (yet)
- User interface
- Determine whether or not a puzzle has multiple solutions
